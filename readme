b(fuck)^2:
    This is a brainfuck compiler which is able to perform most of the brainfuck programs.
    Most of the programs were taken from "http://brainfuck.org/" page, some examples
    are not in ./bfcodes since i didn't understand what they do or how to use them.
    Every brainfuck file has its author, and lot of thanks for those amazing codes :).

    Difference between "(...)" and "[...]" tokens:
    When a loop is defined the idea is run the code inside of the loop's body while
    the current byte ain't zero, however in some cases that condition can change
    for do what's inside the loop's body while the current byte is an alphabetic
    character (ascii_code >= 32).
    So that's the difference, when the compiler reads "(...)" it'll write to this
    while the current byte is an alphabetic character, wheras, when it reads "[...]"
    it'll write do this while the current byte ain't zero.

    Ups...:
    * Comments ain't implemented.
    * Compiler was finished in Feb.23.2023, however maybe new commits will be
      done to future projects.

    Arguments:
    * -f <name>: Brainfuck file to compile.
    * -s <name>: How do you wanna call the out assembly file?
    * -b <n>: How many bytes (memories) do you wanna use?

    Why?
    This project was made to learn a little bit of assembly and to make a simple but
    powerful compiler, and to prove me right about i can do anything if i understand
    how it works since i was about to give up, thaks for didn't.
